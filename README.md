A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for calculating electricity costs using the **Slovenian tariff system** with separated pricing components (energy + network + contributions + excise tax) and full seasonal/holiday support.

## Key Features ✨

- **🗓️ Seasonal Tariffs**: Complete support for higher (November-February) and lower (March-October) seasons
- **🎉 Slovenian Holidays**: Dynamic calculation of all Slovenian holidays including Easter-based dates
- **⚡ VT/MT Energy Tariffs**: High tariff (VT) and low tariff (MT) for electrical energy
- **🔌 Network Tariff Blocks 1-5**: Network charges (omrežnina) based on time, day, and season
- **💰 Complete Price Structure**: Energy + Network + Contributions + Excise Tax
- **📊 Energy Dashboard**: Integration with Home Assistant Energy tab
- **🤖 Automation Support**: Binary sensors for easy device automation
- **📈 Cost Tracking**: Real-time cost calculation based on consumption
- **🎯 6-Decimal Precision**: Accurate pricing to 0.000001 EUR/kWh

## Slovenian Electricity Price Structure 💰

**Total electricity price consists of 4 components:**

1. **Electrical Energy** (VT/MT tariffs)
   - VT (High Tariff): Working days 06:00-22:00
   - MT (Low Tariff): Off-peak hours, weekends, holidays

2. **Network Charges** (Tariff Blocks 1-5) 
   - Distribution network costs (omrežnina)
   - Based on time, day, and season

3. **Contributions** 
   - Regulatory contributions (RES, OVES, etc.)

4. **Excise Tax**
   - Government excise tax on electricity

5. **Enter SEPARATE prices** (EUR/kWh):

   **ENERGY TARIFFS:**
   - **VT Price**: ~0.1199 EUR (high tariff, working hours)
   - **MT Price**: ~0.0979 EUR (low tariff, off-peak)

   **NETWORK CHARGES (tariff blocks):**
   - **Block 1**: ~0.01998 EUR/kWh
   - **Block 2**: ~0.01833 EUR/kWh
   - **Block 3**: ~0.01809 EUR/kWh
